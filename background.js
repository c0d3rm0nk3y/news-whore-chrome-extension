chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({text: "moo"});

/*
random thoughts..

this is where just clicking the happens..

couls use this space to instead of a popup menu to THEN click submit..

i could use the drop down to show a list of recent articles submitted to news-whore server..

i would then have to setup some sort of timer refresh thing..

TO DO:
create a new window to display the content returned by the server..

(on server).. seriously consider a reboot of the server, sometimes errors happen, best start tracking those..
